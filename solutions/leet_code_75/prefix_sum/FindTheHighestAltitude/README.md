# Find the Highest Altitude - LeetCode 1732

## Problem Statement
Given an array `gain` representing net altitude changes between points, find the highest altitude reached. The journey starts at altitude 0, and each element in `gain` represents the change in altitude to the next point.

### Examples
```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: Altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. Highest is 1.

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: Altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. Highest is 0.
```

### Constraints
* `n == gain.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`

## Solution Using Running Sum
### Implementation
```javascript
var largestAltitude = function(gain) {
    let alt = 0;
    let maxAlt = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
        alt = alt + gain[i];
        maxAlt = Math.max(maxAlt, alt);
    }
    return maxAlt;
};
```

### Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is length of gain array
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Key Points:
  - Uses running sum technique
  - Maintains current altitude and maximum altitude seen
  - Updates maximum at each step
  - Returns overall maximum altitude reached

## Technical Deep Dive
### Running Sum Strategy
1. **Variable Management**
   - alt: tracks current altitude
   - maxAlt: tracks highest altitude seen
   - Both initialized at 0 (starting altitude)

2. **Altitude Calculation**
   - Accumulates changes progressively
   - Updates maximum after each change
   - Handles both positive and negative changes

3. **Maximum Tracking**
   - Uses Math.max() for comparison
   - Includes initial altitude of 0
   - Updates only when new maximum found

### Edge Cases and Considerations
- Array with all negative changes
- Array with all positive changes
- Single element array
- Alternating positive and negative changes
- Maximum altitude at different positions:
  - Beginning of journey
  - Middle of journey
  - End of journey
  - At starting point (0)

### Optimization Notes
1. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Could use array methods like reduce()
   - Could use prefix sum array (trade space for readability)
   - Could combine operations in loop

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Current solution uses constant extra space
   - Only tracks two variables
   - No auxiliary data structures needed

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Initial Value Handling**
   - Forgetting to consider 0 as initial altitude
   - Not including 0 in maximum comparison

2. **Running Sum Calculation**
   - Off-by-one errors in accumulation
   - Not handling negative numbers correctly

3. **Maximum Tracking**
   - Not updating maximum at every step
   - Incorrect initialization of maximum value

2. Edge cases (single element)
3. Special patterns (all positive, all negative, alternating)
4. Boundary cases (using constraint values)
5. Zero handling
6. Peak and valley patterns
